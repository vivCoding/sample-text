This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Setup

Make sure you have Node installed (preferably Node v16+). Navigate to the frontend folder and install all necessary packages

```
npm i
```

## Linting

Install the ESLint VSCode extension from Microsoft, and ensure you have linting capabilities.

To auto fix ESLint problems, in VSCode, type `Ctrl + Shift + P`, and then type `ESLint: Fix 
all auto-fixiable problems`. Hit `Enter`, and it should fix most linting issuse.

# Running


## Getting Started

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Lint All
Alternatively from running `Ctrl + Shift + P`, you can run `npm run lint` to detect all ESLint problems and fix them.
